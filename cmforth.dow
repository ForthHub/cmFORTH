Addresses are hex;         word timing in parentheses after  ; ( cycles) .                                                                              1 LOAD  compiles the compacting compiler (blocks 4-6).  Block 6    exits in  COMPILER  vocabulary, anticipating additions.      0<  is redefined to resolve timing conflict.                    END  terminates a definition.                                   REMEMBER;  saves vocabulary heads (at compile time).                                                                            FORTH  puts following words in interpretive vocabulary.         -MOD  provides modular arithmetic.  It does a subtract if the      result is non-negative.                                                                                                      THRU  loads a sequence of blocks.                               EMPTY  empties the dictionary except for compacting compiler.                                                                   H'  holds the next available address in the target dictionary.  2000 relocates target addresses from RAM (2000) to PROM (0).    {  }   switches between host and target dictionary by exchanging   pointers and relocation offsets.                             COMPILER  }  compiles an indirect reference for a headless word.forget  smudges a word that cannot execute in target dictionary.                                                                RECOVER  recovers a return (after  AGAIN ).                                                                                     SCAN  finds the next word in target dictionary.                 TRIM  relocates the vocabulary link and erases the smudge bit.  CLIP  constructs a target vocabulary and stores its head.       PRUNE  relinks the target dictionary to produce a stand-alone     application (fixing the end-of-vocabulary word)                 and restores the host dictionary.                                                                                             3 LOAD  recompiles cmFORTH.  EMPTY  clears dictionary for a new    application.                                                 2 LOAD  compiles the target compiler.                           Target is compiled at 2000 which is initialized to 0.           BOOT  copies PROM to RAM at power-up.  The reference to -1         disables PROM and enables RAM (setting A15 clocks 74).       Low RAM (16-24) is initialized (see block 12).                                                                                  #  is the bottom of the target dictionary.  PRUNE  changes its     name to null and link to 0.  This version of  EXIT  marks the   end of both vocabulary chains.                               The address of  RESET  is relocated into the end of  BOOT .     The end of target program is stored into  TIB  and  HERE .         COMPILER  head is selected for  PRUNE .                      GO  emulates  BOOT  for testing:  3 LOAD  GO                                                                                    FORTH  sets interpretive vocabulary for both searches and         definitions.  Words are compiled in definitions.              COMPILER  sets immediate vocabulary.  Words are executed in  : .uCODE  names a NC4016 micro-coded instruction.  Compiled on use.\  compiles a following compiler directive (that would normally    be executed).  Named  [COMPILE]  in FORTH-83.                                                                                4016 instructions:                                                 !-   stores and decrements.  I@!  exchanges stack&register.     NOP  delays 1 cycle.         TWO  delays 2 cycles.              0+c  Adds 0 with carry.     MOD'  conditionally subtracts R4.   N!   stores and saves data.   -1  fetches register 3                                                                         DUP?  compacts preceeding  DUP  with current instruction.  Used    to redefine  I!  and  PUSH (previously  >R ).                                                                                PACK  sets the return bit, if an instruction does not reference   the Return stack.  Otherwise it compiles a return.  It exits    from  EXIT  with  POP DROP .                                                                                                  EXIT  optimizes return if permitted ( ?CODE  nonzero):             For instructions (bit-15 = 1) it calls  PACK  except for jump      or 2-cycle instructions;                                     for calls to the same 4K page, it substitutes a jump.                                                                        ;  is redefined to use the new  EXIT .                                                                                          CONSTANT  is redefined to take advantage of the new  EXIT  for     5-bit literals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              BINARY  defines and compacts ALU instructions.  If the previous    instruction was a fetch (ALU code 7) and not a store or  DROP   the ALU code is merged;  stack push is inhibited.  Otherwise    a new instruction is compiled.  ?CODE  holds address of         candidate for compaction.                                                                                                    SHIFT  defines and compacts shift instructions.  Shift left        ( 2* ) and right ( 2/) may be merged with an arithmetic         instruction;  sign propagate ( 0< ) only with  DUP .                                                                         DROP  OR  XOR  AND  +  -  SWAP-  are redefined.                 2*  2/  0<  likewise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ROT  is a slow way to reference into the stack.                                                                                 0=  returns false (0) if stack non-zero; otherwise true ( -1).

ARRAY  defines an array that adds an index from stack in only      2 cycles.  Similar to  VARIABLE .                                                                                            These low-RAM variables are used by cmFORTH (0-F are unused).      Change them cautiously!  In particular, make sure a variable    is not used during compilation.  For example,  HEX  is          redefined to set  BASE .  It can be used if  BASE  has not      moved;  otherwise it must be forgetted.                      Non-standard variables:                                            ?CODE  address of last instruction compiled.  Zero indicates       no compaction permitted (ie, after  THEN ).                  dA  offset to be added to compiled addresses.  Normally 0.         Relocated code cannot be executed!                           CURSOR  tracks cursor (terminal dependent); used by  EXPECT .   S0  serial output polarity; 1FF or 200.                         C/B  cycles/bit for serial I/O.                              EMIT  sets Xmask to 1E so that only X0 can be changed.  Start/     stop bits are added and polarity set.  I!  emits bits at C/B    rate thru X0.                                                CR  emits carriage-return and line-feed.                                                                                        TYPE  types a string with prefixed count byte.  It returns an      incremented cell address.  This is not FORTH-83 standard.                                                                    RX  reads a bit from pin X4.                                    KEY  reads 8-bits from X4.  It waits for a start bit, then         delays until the middle of the first data bit.  Each bit is     sampled then ored into bit 7 of the accumulated byte.  It       does not exit until the stop bit (low) is detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                          SPACE  emits a space.                                           SPACES  emits  n>0  spaces.                                     HOLD  holds characters on the stack, maintaining a count.          It reverses the digits resulting from number conversion.                                                                     EXPECT  accepts keystrokes and buffers them (at  TIB ).  An 8      will discard a character and emit a backspace;  a D will        emit a space and exit; all other keys are stored and echoed     until the count is exhausted.  Actual count is in  SPAN .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    DIGIT  converts a digit (0-F) into an ASCII character.          <#  starts conversion by tucking a count under the number.      #>  ends conversion by emitting the string of digits.           SIGN  stacks a minus sign, if needed.                           #  converts the low-order digit of a 16-bit number.             #S  converts non-zero digits, at least one.                     (.)  formats a signed number.                                   .  displays a 16-bit signed integer, followed by a space.                                                                       U.R  displays a right-justified 16-bit unsigned number.         U.  displays an unsigned number.                                DUMP  displays an address and 8 numbers from memory.  It           returns an incremented address for a subsequent  DUMP .                                                                                                                                                                                                      HERE  returns next address in dictionary.                                                                                       abort"  types the current word (at  HERE ) and an error message    (at  I )  It also returns the current  BLK  to locate an        error during  LOAD .  It will end with  QUIT , when defined.    It is a headless definition, referenced only by  ABORT" .    dot"  types a message whose address is pulled off the return       stack, incremented and replaced.                                                                                             ABORT"  compiles  abort"  and the following string.  This is a     host  COMPILER  definition.  The target definition is in        block 30.                                                    ."  compiles  dot"  and the following string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   BUFFERS  returns indexed address of buffer ID.                  PREV  current buffer number (0-NB).                             OLDEST  last buffer read.  Next buffer is  OLDEST @ 1 + .       ADDRESS  calculates a buffer address from buffer number.  NB is    1.  If increased,  ADDRESS  and  BUFFERS  must be also.      ABSENT  returns the block number when the requested block isn't    already in RAM.  Otherwise it returns the buffer address and    exits from  BLOCK .                                          UPDATED  returns the buffer address and current block number if    the pending buffer has been  UPDATEd .  Otherwise it returns    the buffer address and exits from the calling routine ( BLOCK   or BUFFER ).  Pending means oldest but not just used.        UPDATE  marks the current buffer ( PREV ) to be rewritten.      ESTABLISH  stores the block number of the current buffer.       IDENTIFY  stores a block number into the current buffer.  Used     to copy blocks.                                              ##  emits 3 bytes to host to start a block transfer;  0 followed   by block number.                                                                                                             buffer  transmits an updated block and awaits acknowledgement.  BUFFER  returns address of an empty (but assigned) buffer.                                                                      block  reads a block.                                           BLOCK  returns the buffer address of a specified block, writing    and reading as necessary.                                                                                                    FLUSH  forces buffers to be written.                            EMPTY-BUFFERS  clears buffer IDs, without writing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              LETTER  moves a string of characters from cell address  a  to      byte address  b .  Terminated by count ( # ) or delimitor       (register 6).  Input pointer  >IN  is advanced.                                                                              -LETTER  scans the source string for a non-delimiter.  If found,   calls  LETTER .                                                                                                              WORD  locates text in either block buffer or  TIB  ( BLK  is 0).   Reads word into  HERE  prefixing count and suffixing a space    (in case count even).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        SAME  compares the string at  HERE  with a name field.  Cell       count is in register 6.  High bit of each cell is ignored.      Returns address of parameter field; requires indirect           reference if high bit of count set (separated head).                                                                         COUNT  extracts the cell count from the first word of a string. HASH  returns the address of the head of a vocabulary.          -FIND  searches a vocabulary for match with  HERE .  Fails with    zero link field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             -DIGIT  converts an ASCII character to a digit (0-Z).              Failure generates an error message.                                                                                          C@+  increments address in register 6 and fetches character.    10*+  multiplies number by  BASE  and adds digit.               NUMBER  converts given string to binary;  stores  BASE  in R4;     saves minus sign;  terminates on count;  applies sign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        -'  searches vocabulary for following word.

BPS  awaits a start bit, assumes only the first data bit is        zero and computes  C/B .  Type a  B  or other even letter.   RS232  examines the serial input line and inverts serial I/O if    an inverting buffer is used (line rests low).                                                                                reset  is executed at power-up or reset.                          Carefully initializes I/O registers to avoid glitches.          Empties buffers at power-up only ( TIB  contains garbage).      Calibrates serial I/O.

This is the beginning of the compiler.  A turn-key application     might need only the code above.                                                                                              Common words are defined for both interpreter and compiler.                                                                     Number base words defined together;  DECIMAL  required.                                                                         LOAD  saves current input pointers,  calls  INTERPRET , restores   input pointers and returns to  DECIMAL .   >IN  and  BLK  are   treated as a 32-bit pointer.  forget  so that host  LOAD        will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\  breaks code compaction.                                     ALLOT  increments the dictionary pointer to allot memory.       ,  compiles a number into the dictionary.                       ,C  compiles an instruction available for compaction.           ,A  compiles a address relocated by  dA .                       LITERAL  compiles a number as a short literal, if possible.     [  stops compilation by popping the return stack, thus returning   out of the infinite  ]  loop.                                                                                                ]  unlike  INTERPRET , searches both vocabularies before falling   into  NUMBER .  When a word is found in  COMPILER  it is        executed;  if found in  FORTH  it is compiled.  If it is a      single instruction, it is placed in-line;  otherwise its        address is compiled for a call.                                                                                                                                                              PREVIOUS  returns the address and count of the name field of       the word just defined.                                       USE  assigns to the previous word a specified code field.       DOES  provides a behavior for a newly defined word.  It is         executed when that word is defined.                          SMUDGE  smudges the name field to avoid recursion.              EXIT  returns from a definition early ( FORTH  version).                                                                        COMPILE  pops the address of the following word and compiles it.   7FFF AND  masks the carry bit from the return stack.         EXIT  compiles a return instruction ( COMPILER  version).       RECURSIVE  unsmudges the name field so a new word can be found. ;  terminates a definition.  forget  permits more definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                  CREATE  creates an entry in the dictionary.  It saves space for   the link field, then fetches a word terminated by space.  It    links the word into the proper vocabulary, allots space for     the name field and compiles the return-next-address             instruction appropriate for a variable.                                                                                       :  creates a definition;  -1 ALLOT  recovers the instruction       compiled by  CREATE ;  ]  compiles the definition in its        place.  forget  permits more definitions.                                                                                    CONSTANT  names a number by compiling a literal.                                                                                VARIABLE  initializes its variable to zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -SHORT  checks if last instruction was a 5-bit literal.         FIX  merges 5-bit literal with new instruction.                 SHORT  requires 5-bit literal (register, address or increment)     for current instruction.

I@  and  I!  compile 5-bit register instuctions.                @+ and !+  compile 5-bit increment instructions.                                                                                PUSH  and  POP  push and pop the return stack.                     They are usually designated  >R  and  R> .                   I  copies the return stack onto the parameter stack.            TIMES  pushes the return stack to repeat the next instruction      for  n + 2  cycles.                                                                                                                                                                          OR,  compiles a 12-bit address with a backward jump instruction.BEGIN  saves  HERE  for backward jumps.

NEXT  compiles a backward decrement-and-jump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   STRING  compiles a character string with a specified delimiter.                                                                 ABORT"  DOT"  are target versions of previously-defined host       words.
