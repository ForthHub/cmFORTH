BASE'  defines literal input words which use the base that is      given when the word is defined.  This allows a hex number       to be input with H' even when the base is currently decimal     or any other base.                                           ASCII  allows entry of a single ascii character as a literal       value.  Usage: ASCII X .  The binary value of X is left on      the stack.  May be used to compile an ascii character into      a word definition.

They can display        one more instruction with the space bar, 15 more by pressing    P, and quit the decompiler by pressing Q.                                                                                   SEE                                                                 Decompile the next word in the input stream.                    e.g.  SEE MYWORD                                                                                                            SEE'                                                                Decompile the word at the given hex address.  Useful for        decompiling headerless words.                                   e.g.  SEE' 125F                                                                                                                                                                             IP0                                                                 The address of the first instruction in the definition          being debugged.                                             IP                                                                  The address of the current breakpoint.                      CFA                                                                 The instruction that used to be at the breakpoint.          RESTART                                                             Set IP back to the beginning of the definition.             UNBUG                                                               Remove the breakpoint if any.

IP and CFA are historical terms once used by Forth programmers!                                                                 DO-ELSE  Move IP to the destination of a branch.                         Don't move further back than IP0.                      DO-IF    Check top of stack and move IP to the destination if            the branch will be taken, otherwise advance one.       DO-LOOP  Determine if loop will branch or not and set IP                 accordingly.  R> R> R> removes the nesting levels               taken to get here from the original definition.        EXIT?    Leave true flag if the next instruction has the                 return bit set.                                        DO-ALU   ALU instructions are always one cell.  Set IP back to           the beginning of the definition if the return bit is            set.                                                   DO-MEM   Make special check for full literal fetch instructions          that occupy two cells.  Also check for exit.                                                                                                                                           DO-STRING                                                           Move IP to the end of a string literal.                                                                                     DO-CALL                                                             Move IP to the next instruction.  Skip the inline string        for ." .  Treat ABORT" and QUIT as exit words and reset         the IP to the beginning of the definition.  Any new control     structures such as CASE and DO .. LOOP as well as any words     that take inline literal must be added along with routines      to determine where to set the next breakpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              NEXT-BKPT                                                           Move IP to the next address to set the breakpoint.  This        will usually be the next instruction but may not be for         branching instructions or instructions that use inline          literals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   .TRACE                                                              Display breakpoint information.  The stack is shown             and the next instruction to be executed is decompiled.          The user is prompted to input a command.  This routine          may be expanded to display critical variables etc.                                                                          RES                                                                 Flag to resume debugger.                                    INTERP                                                              A mini text interpreter.  Get input from the user and           interpret it until they type RESUME.  You can look at           variables, alter the stack etc.                             RESUME                                                              Set the resume flag.                                                                                                                                                                        PATCH                                                               Patch in the address of the breakpoint routine at the           address in IP.  Save the original instruction in CFA.       TRACE                                                               The breakpoint routine.  Restore CFA and back up the            address on the return stack so we will execute that             instruction when we exit.  Display trace information and        process a one key command.  Then patch in the next              breakpoint so we will execute a single instruction.                                                                         (PATCH)                                                             Now we know the address of TRACE we can define PATCH.
