Friends:

	If you previously downloaded S8_NOVIX.ARC there was an error on
	screen 13 in the references to Amiga structures that is fixed
	in the accompanying version of S8_NOVIX.ARC. The only bug was
	that when you thought you would be disabling XON/XOFF for the
	Novix, which does not respect that protocol under cmForth, you
	would not be doing so, so every ascii hex 13 would hang ...

	If you downloaded JAXA4VDT.ARC, the same bug on the same screen
	applies. The fix in the accompanying file to this note applies.

	regards, jack woehr
